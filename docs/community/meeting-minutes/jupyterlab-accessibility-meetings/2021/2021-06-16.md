### What are people working on?

- Isabela
  - [#10146](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10146) was merged! This made some color contrast fixes to the filebrowser and command palette.
  - There are still more to-do fixes on the [issue it draws from](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/8832). Has anyone worked on/know where the various search UIs (in the file browser, command palette, and/or extensions) are in the code base?
  - I'm going to the BinderHub team meeting later today to follow up on the AWS blocking and get request a long-term solution.
  - [Accessibility workshop](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/43) follow up! We are aiming to have an event by late August/early September.
  - Someone pointed me to W3C's [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/). Passing it on.
- Kevin and Cameron
