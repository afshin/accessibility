### What are people working on?

- Jenn and Erik
  - Hello from [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu/) and [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)!
  - Jupyter notebooks aren't accessible and we'd like them to be.
  - We've been working with [GLAS Education](https://www.glaseducation.org/) to test our own work with blind and visually impaired people.
- Nick
  - documentation as an area also lacking accessibility
  - Still trying to get pydata-sphinx-theme PRs merged ([Lighthouse testing](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/206) and [pa11y testing](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/294))
- Mike
  - question: are outputs returned by kernel, say data frames, accessible/is it being worked on by anyone? I know there is a lot of work on UX, but I wonder how much work will be there in downstream packages which provide outputs
    - [Max] _if youâ€™re talking about the fancy pandas dataframe rendering, the answer is definitely not. There are wcag/aria specs for how to make a grid accessible, tho_
    - [Jason] _That would be awesome if the frontend supported some innate dataframe mimetype which it could render in an accessible way_
  - question: `aria-label` vs `title` (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10727/files#r685601307)
    - Should this be defined from the toolbar button instead of the tooltip?
    - Isabela will test the binder and see how the current implmentation works.
