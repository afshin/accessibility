### What are people working on?

- Martha

  - Found out that JLab has a focus manager that might override native browser focus (which could cause us a lot of accesibility problems potentially). It looks like this might not cause a problem because
  - It is inherrited from [lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/blob/f434ff8bc751b58cc27b9cf0ab7cb31318e8dd15/packages/widgets/src/focustracker.ts)
  - Merged [jupyterlab/lumino #174](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/174) setting `tabindex` to 0 in the menubar. Be on the look out for if this breaks anything unexpectedly.
  - Thomas says the only reason he can think of that you can hard code a tabindex is if you need an area to be focused first, but it's better practice to rearrange the HTML to do what you want.
  - role=menuitem needs a tabindex assigned to make sure this gets the proper treatment.
  - Menu items also need a `disabled` ARIA label.
  - Closed [#9491](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9491) :tada:

- MJ

  - Draft PR [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #10126](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10126) for proof of concept making sure the `skiplink` is going in the right place. Looking for feedback on where that component fits in JupyterLab's architecture.
  - Thomas says skiplink always needs to be the first thing on a page, all hacks aside.
  - Max says it might make the most sense to implement it as a widget and add it that way. Put the generalizable part of the code into the widget and the rest elsewhere.
  - Martha and MJ think it might make more sense to add it to an existing widget because it is a small amount of code and should be in all front ends. If that's the case, Martha and Max think `labshell` in [here in `shell.ts`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/master/packages/application/src/shell.ts#L199) is the best place for it to live not as an extension.

- Tony

  - Integrated Galata and axe-core to get some testing and automated reports started.

- Isabela
  - First round of CZI grant application was accepted so we'll be working on the next step. You can read the full letter of intent at [jupyter/accessibility #44](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/44). I think we'll also be looking for community review for this next step?
  - Workshop updates on [jupyter/accessibility #43](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/43). I'm trying to follow up with that.
  - My attempts on fixing color contrast in the sidebar and command palette have a very very very draft PR at [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #10101](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10101). I may not be capable of making all the changes I want myself, but I am trying to do all I can on my own first.

### Next Steps

- Be aware of the focus manager and be on the look out for any problems it might cause (everyone)
- Work on the [skiplink PR](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10126) based on in-meeting feedback and let us know when it's ready for review! (MJ)
- Get a testing demo running (Tony)
- Fix CZI PDF PR to be in a different directory (Isabela)
- Work on the [sidebar and command palette color contrast PR](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10101) and let us know when it's ready for review (Isabela)
