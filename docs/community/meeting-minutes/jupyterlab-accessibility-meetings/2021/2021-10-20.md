### What are people working on?

- Isabela

  - Jupyter accessibility workshops are going through budget approvals now. That's where I'll be halfway through our meeting today.
  - October 25 I will have someone starting with development time devoted to JupyterLab accessibility. Yay! You'll get to meet them soon. (This is made possible by the [CZI EOSS grant](https://blog.jupyter.org/czi-awards-three-eoss-grants-to-jupyter-community-members-6aef43bd9468))
  - This also means I'll have devoted time for accessibility again, so this will help me go back to making contributions.

- Jenn

  - funding question
  - needs to be scoped
  - can have external partners
  - needs follow up

- Mike: just highlighting file system review in https://github.com/jupyterlab/design
  - Extensions and accessibility assessment. Are extensions in the JupyterLab organization the next step?
  - is there an accessibility repo?
    - there is https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/1
    - but no repo as for today
    - might be worth to have a repo with acessibility team-compas and to upload artifacts (slides/notes/recommendations) and link to these notes

### Next Steps

- Follow up with Jenn about funding (Isabela+)
