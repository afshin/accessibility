### What are people working on?

- Isabela

  - Can I add a checklist comment to [#9491](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9491)? I want to double check that I'm correct about what's been done.
    - There are other blockers still preventing this from getting completed.
    - [#9622](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9622) merging almost fixes this! Wow!
    - Are there tests? Not yet. We need to be able to verify that this hasn't been overwritten by other work before closing. Aiming for test utils.
  - CZI grant update at [#36](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/36).

- Gonzalo

  - Canâ€™t make it to the meeting. Will be releasing the lang packs soon.

- Pete

  - PR [jupyter/accessibility #37](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/37)
  - Is this a nbformat fix, or an IPython fix?
    - Probably IPython first will be a big win.
  - Looking into cell outputs having alt text for those by default. This is something we haven't looked into yet.
  - We had a good discussion that clarified some of the nuances to this, so now people need to look into questions and comment on the issue.

- Martha

  - [#9622](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9622) and [#132](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/132) both merged! Looking for new item to work on
    - Double check 9491 to see if it can be closed.
  - Look into a comment on [jupyterlab/team-compass #98](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass/issues/98#issuecomment-768800666)

- MJ

  - Got some [questions](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/discussions/38) when working on the skip link issue [#9688](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9688)
  - Further discussion about how a `skiplink` should work. Should it just skip to content (notebook), or give options to major regions like the content, top menu bar, left sidebar, right sidebar.
    - Thomas' recommendation is roughly:
      - first tab = main toolbar
      - second tab = left side bar
      - third tab = inside left sidebar section
      - fourth tab = right sidebar
      - fifth tab = inside right sidebar section
  - Tabindex should be 0. Do we need to fix tabindex before skiplink?
    - Shouldn't be a blocker. This will need to be changed, but won't block skiplink as long as you don't hardcode your tabindex values.

- Thomas

  - What is the best resources/instructions for getting a project stood up on my computer for making these accessibility changes.
    - https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/contributing.html
    - https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/contributing.html#linking-unlinking-packages-to-jupyterlab
    - [jupyter/accessibility binder PR](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/20)?
    - VSCode handles typescript better than some other IDEs. That might help.
  - Added [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #10004](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10004) and [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #10008](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10008) issues based on past discussions. These break up certain compliances by disability.

- Nick
  - Pa11y PR in accessibility repo. If this isn't a CI-needing repo maybe we target these tests on another branch so it doesn't slow don't meeting notes and readme PRs. Check [jupyter/accessibility #35](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/35)

### Other notes

- Is hackmd a good notetaking platform for people and do you like having a markdown file for the long-term version of the notes? Did you like Tony's issue method better?

### Next steps

- Edit one Phosphor tutorial video to see if it helps with the small screen. (Isabela)
- Turn [#9491](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9491) to checklist (Martha and Tony) so we can tell its status more clearly. This may be almost closed/resolved.
- Release language packs (Gonzalo)
- Review ideas for Pete's issue and comment on it (Nick and Tony)
- Look into what to work on next starting with [jupyterlab/team-compass #98](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass/issues/98#issuecomment-768800666) comment (Martha)
- Continue with `skiplink` work (MJ) :sunflower:
- Figure out where Pa11y tests fit with jupyter/accessibility.

### Merged PRs (let's celebrate!)
