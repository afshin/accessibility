### What are people working on?

- Martha
  - Checking out the focus part of [this issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9491). Not sure if changes are for lumino or JL but I suspect it's lumino
  - There's also no visual indicator of focus which has made this more difficult to test. Browser dev modes should be able to expose this.
- Isabela
  - Coming back to [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #8832](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/8832) with the sidebar and command palette. I'm trying to unpack where all the elements I need to change are in the code.
  - Closing issues in the accessibility repo.
- Thomas
  - Tried to set up local JLab for development. Got blocked but will return.
- Jessica
  - Checking in about whether or not/how arrow keys are reserved for keyboard navigation in order to move forward with an issue.
  - Using just arrow keys is not best practice. It's best they are reserved.
- Tony
  - Has been looking into accessibility testing ecosystem. Lots of JS tools, no Python tools. Some component systems seem to have built in support.
  - How do we move forward with this? Should there be an extension? Can we have this in core JupyterLab?
- Jason
  - Shared [focus-visible](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible) to follow up on focus discussion.
