### What are people working on?

- MJ
  - Looking for review on [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #10126](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10126), a pull request to address `skiplink` needs discussed at [#9688](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9688).
  - Martha and Max followed up, thank you!
  - It seems like a suggestion may have broken the implementation, so we are trying to get it working again.
- Isabela
  - Still focusing mainly on grant writing.
  - Haven't gotten to work on the draft color contrast PR at [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #10146](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10146).
- Tony
  - How do we keep up community momentum?

### Next Steps

- Changes to get skiplink merged
- Grant writing update and public review
