### What are people working on?

- Ely
  - Accessibility workshop is tomorrow!
    - [Here is the workshop agenda](https://hackmd.io/JmEN6JIMTn6f9IKuLCoo0Q)
    - Anyone can join in from the community calendar
- Chadi
  - Getting involved/onboarding needs to support accessibility
  - Sharing work around summarizing accessibility needs
- Carlos
  - RTC user identification uses colors. How to use distinct and accessible color palettes is being discussed on [jupyterlab/jupyterlab issue #11641](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/11641).
    - This issue is based on [a thread on jupyterlab/jupyterlab PR #114430](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11443#discussion_r761473200)
  - Ely: seems like it needs to be a set of variables defined by the theme since themes can vary so much
  - Tony shares [WCAG 3 will use a new color contrast method called APCA (Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm)](https://twitter.com/DanHollick/status/1468958644364402702)
- Isabela
  - Jupyter accessibility events updates! More updates to come, and you can always reference [the quansight-labs/jupyter-accessbility-workshops repo](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-accessibility-workshops)
  - [jupyterlab/jupyterlab PR #11658](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11658) is work on color contrast. I've gotten some review but there's lots to discuss.
  - Roadmap updates (for CZI grant reporting and community communication) based on all your feedback. You can review the PR [Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt #60](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/pull/60). When we get it cleaned up, it will go to jupyter/accessibility so it's more findable by the community.
