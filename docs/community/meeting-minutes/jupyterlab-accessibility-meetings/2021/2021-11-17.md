### What are people working on?

- Shared with us: [Accessibility notebook experiment exploring sound interactions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hassaku/colab-a11y-utils/blob/master/colab_a11y_util_example.ipynb#scrollTo=021Jdm2npMLf)
- Jason Grout mentioned [colab-a11y-utils](https://pypi.org/project/colab-a11y-utils/). It may be good to explore this package.
- Frederic
  - working on a windowed notebook - this will certainly raise accessibility issue
    - Headers may already not be working well. [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #11374 Anchors are not working properly](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/11374)
    - Virtual rendering in other contexts: [Google Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html), [genome browsers](http://2020.ensembl.org/genome-browser/homo_sapiens_GCA_000001405_28?focus=gene:ENSG00000141510&location=17:7544013-7862190)
  - Testing basic components against accessiblity: sharing an example from VS Code (didnot look at the techno used):
    - https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit/ - This is a storybook website that got a Accessibility tests report  
      ![Webview UI Toolkit's interface showing a list of accessibility test results for a component](https://i.imgur.com/aKRjl2E.png)
    - GitHub repo: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit
- Tony
  - Notebook 7 efforts are meant to include accessibility efforts [more info on the plan for Notebook 7](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/6210#issuecomment-957169113)
  - Nick mentions wanting resources that help accessibility be a part of development as a focus of the repo. Should we be testing things like [Lorenz notebook](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/blob/master/notebooks/Lorenz.ipynb) in accessibility tests?
- Jason W
  - Resources for working on jupyterlab, retrolab, other packages simultaneously?
    - [doit automation file](https://pydoit.org/task_args.html) https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/blob/master/dodo.py
    - [Linking/Unlinking Packages to JupyterLab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/contributing.html#linking-unlinking-packages-to-jupyterlab)
    - [An example of testing such things in jupyter/accessibility](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/35)
    - [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/)
- Gabriel
  - Poking around the JupyterLab code base, running Galata tests
- Isabela
  - With the CZI EOSS grant, we will be updating our progress via a roadmap.
  - Let's talk about the current [draft roadmap PR](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/pull/60).
  - What information would you all want on this roadmap?
    - Linking to issues might be nice. Which issues make sense (we have duplicate issues across some repositories)?
    - Add another page "changelog" that lists what we have completed when things get moved off the roadmap.
    - Are there repository labels/tags that make sense to link to?
