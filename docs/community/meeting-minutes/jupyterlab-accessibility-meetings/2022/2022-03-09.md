### Agenda

- Gabriel
  - What do developers want/what would you all find helpful in the [jupyter/accessibility repo](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility)
    - - People can give feedback and ideas later via issues (or PRs if you have something you want to contribute) on jupyter/accessibility.
  - What I'm working on, just FYI:
    - [Adding checkboxes to JupyterLab file browser](https://github.com/jupyterlab/retrolab/issues/260#issuecomment-1035610998)
    - [Adding infrastructure to run automated accessibility tests](https://github.com/gabalafou/accessibility/tree/axe/tests/retrolab)
- Jason W
  - [JupyterLab cell toolbar PR 12028](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/12028) â€” Feedback sought on usability, accessibility, etc.
    - Tab behavior is consistent throughout JupyterLab (which is good), but it's JupyterLab's tab behavior that doesn't make sense. This may need to be a separate issue.
      - Tabbing through regions is discussed in https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9688
    - Focus is working throughout, so there is nothing that relies solely on a hover state (good!)
    - How this interacts with a cell's command versus edit state is interesting. Navigating the toolbar happens in command mode, but tabbing fully through the toolbar transitions to edit mode with no immediate way back (instead users must return to the start of command mode outside the cell). This is to preserve the use of tab for code completion in a cell, something we do need to preserve.

  - brings up discussion at [matplotlib/matplotlib #15971 Improve the accessibility of figures shown with `_repr_html_`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15971#issuecomment-1062772917) around deprecation of `longdesc` and if there are ways this can be solved in a better experience and not only one-off tags.
