- Gabriel
  - Mapping out and comparing frontend of JupyterLab and RetroLab
- Chadi
  - How to get involved with Jupyter accessibility work
    - Review tasks on the [JupyterLab accessibility project board](https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/1)
    - Focus on documentation fixes. Some could be adding alt text, making sure things are up to date.
    - Make changes to documentation theming that supports accessibility across projects (find test background on https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11803 and https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/548)
    - Open issues based on what isn't working for you! We're relying heavily on standards, but user feedback would be even better.
- Nick
  - exploring [robotframework-axelibrary](https://github.com/adiralashiva8/robotframework-axelibrary) as a thing to add to [JupyterLibrary](https://github.com/robots-from-jupyter/robotframework-jupyterlibrary)
    - should be possible to e.g. configure `Test Teardown` to `Collect Accessibility Violations`
      - ...and when error conditions arise
    - tag with violations which would bubble up to
  - potentially blocked by limited maintainer effort on upstreams
  - also have some data analysis tools for long-term ingest of many robot reports
  - both could be injected into e.g. [robotkernel](https://github.com/robots-from-jupyter/robotkernel/issues/72)
