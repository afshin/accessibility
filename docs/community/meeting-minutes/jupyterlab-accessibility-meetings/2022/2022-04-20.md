- Meeting this Friday, April 22: FAST-based JupyterLab UI toolkit. This is a discussion around [the proposal for a new JupyterLab UI toolkit](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass/issues/143), which we've seen demo'ed for accessibility considerations.

- Isabela

  - [isabela-pf/a11y-events Brainstorm list of event ideas](https://github.com/isabela-pf/a11y-events/issues/4)
  - [Scoping automated testing steps](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mUmZevaEI1HwZQ0uF5Rjhb9mGEJ71RAkjj-Lxr3sLZw/edit?usp=sharing)

- Gabriel

  - A [plan for the next six weeks](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/97) that Quansight Labs is considering
    - A number of learnings about **automated accessibility tests** has been rolled into that doc
  - We are looking for pathways to contributions from other people - especially in this group

- Nick

  - [Model-based testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_testing). Build a user model of somebody using the Jupyter test. A model is more interesting that a particular case because you get to weird error messages and corner cases that we need to test for.
  - [A close example with stateful, property-based testing in Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stateful.html)
  - Workflow is not to do this all thinking about it as a test, but more as a state and task combo (ie. I'm looking at a notebook and I want to )

- on the subject of building up a language to create test plans (Isabela metaphor: magnetic fridge poetry)
