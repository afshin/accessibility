# Jupyter Accessibility Audits

This is the collection of accessibility audits in the Jupyter ecosystem. Each
one of these identifies the current accessibility and usability state of the
interface regarding a given area or topic, usability with assistive technology,
and improvement strategies in order to fix shortcomings and/or failures on each
of the topics.

The main goals of these audits are:

1. Identify accessibility barriers in the software.
2. Identify ways to remove the barriers found.

An overarching goal of this work is to improve usability for disabled users.
