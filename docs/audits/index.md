# JupyterLab Accessibility Audits

This is the compendium of accessibility audits in JupyterLab. Each one of these
identifies the current state of the interface regarding a given accessibility
tool, area or topic as well as improvement strategies in order to fix
shortcomings and/or failures on each of the topics.

The aim of the findings is to determine the improvements needed in
JupyterLab so disabled users avoid complicated strategies and workflows that
may prevent them to use the software in its 100%.
