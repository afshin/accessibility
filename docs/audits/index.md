# Jupyter Accessibility Audits

This is the compendium of accessibility audits in the Jupyter ecosystem. Each
one of these identifies the current state of the interface regarding a given
accessibility tool, area or topic as well as improvement strategies in order
to fix shortcomings and/or failures on each of the topics.

The aim of the findings is to determine the improvements needed for disabled
users to avoid complicated strategies and workflows that may prevent them to
use the software in its 100%.
